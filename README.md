## Preparing & Planing

The first step was to find all the parts and document them into a [Part List][2]. I organized the parts with status symbols and order-links. While the project advances this list will be updated. To choose the wanted switches the first part to order is a kailh switch tester. Other parts that don't need the switches are ordered also in the first step.
